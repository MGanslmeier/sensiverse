\title{Partial-probability changes by specification feature}
\usage{
pp_change_by_feature(model, df, ref_outcome = "not significant")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted \code{nnet::multinom} object.}

\item{df}{A dataset produced by \code{make_source_dataset()}.}

\item{ref_outcome}{Character. Outcome level to reference (must exist in \code{df$outcome}).}
}
\value{
Data frame of probability levels and differences by feature/value.
}
\description{
Computes the change in predicted probabilities for each outcome class when
toggling one feature at a time away from a baseline spec.
